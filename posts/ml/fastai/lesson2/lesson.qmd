# ML Deployment
These are notes from lesson 2 of Fast AI Practical Deep Learning for Coders.

::: {.callout-tip title="Homework Task"}

- Deploy a model to Huggingface Spaces: see [car classifier model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/GurpreetJohl/binary_image_classifier_vw_rr)
- Deploy a model to a Github Pages website: see [car classifier website](https://github.com/gjohl/vw_classifier)

## 1. Data Pre-processing
It can be useful to train a model on the data **BEFORE** you clean it

- Counterintuitive!
- The confusion matrix output of the learner gives you a good intuition about which classifications are hard
- `plot_top_losses` shows which examples were hardest for the model to classify. 
  This can find (1) when the model is correct but not confident, and (2) when the model was confident but incorrect
- `ImageClassifierCleaner` shows the examples in the training and validation set ordered by loss, so we can choose to keep, reclassify or remove them

For image resizing, *random resize crop* can often be more effective.

- Squishing can result in weird, unrealistic images.
- Padding or mirroring can add false information that the model will erroneously learn.
- Random crops give different sections of the image which acts as a form of data augmentation.
- `aug_transforms` can be use for more sophisticated data augmentation like warping and recoloring images.


## 2. Saving a model
Once you are happy with the model you've trained, you can pickle the learner object and save it.
```Python
learn.export('model.pkl')
```

Then you can add the saved model to the hugging face space.
To use the model to make predictions, any external functions you used to create the model will need to be instantiated too. 
```Python
learn = load_learner('model.pkl')
learn.predict(image)
```

## 3. Hosting a model

[Hugging face spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) hosts models with a choice of pre-canned interfaces
to quickly deploy a model to the public. Gradio is used in the example in the lecture. Streamlit is an alternative to Gradio that is more flexible.

Gradio requires a dict of classes as keys and probabilities (as floats not tensors) as the values.
To go from the Gradio prototype to a production app, you can view the Gradio API from the huggingface space which will show you the API.
The API exposes an endpoint which you can then hit from your own frontend app.

Github pages is a free and simple way to host a public website.
See [this fastai repo](https://github.com/fastai/tinypets) as an example of a minimal example html website which issues GET requests to the Gradio API 


## 4. Using nbdev
To convert a notebook to a python script, you can add `#|export` to the top of any cells to include in the script,
then use:
```Python
from nbdev.export import notebook2script
notebook2script('name_of_output_file.py')
```

Use `#|default_exp app` in the first cell of the notebook to set the default name of the exported python file.


## 5. Training the Model (and when to stop)
How do we choose the number of epochs to train for?
Whenever it is "good enough" for your use case.

If you need to train for longer, you may need to use data augmentation to prevent overfitting.
Keep an eye on the validation error to check overfitting.
