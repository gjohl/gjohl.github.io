    "## 1. Graphs: What and Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are a generic way of representing relationships (edges) between entities (nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes them useful in a wide variety of applications, including modelling biological pathways, social networks, or even images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs do not have a fixed structure and the relationships (edges) can be time-varying.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Graph Jargon\n",
    "\n",
    "Entities are **nodes or vertices** and their relationships are **edges**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes that are connected are **adjacent** and are called **neighbours**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are the general case of trees. A graph is broadly something with nodes and edges. A tree is a graph that has *no cycles* and all nodes are *connected*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **directed graph** or **digraph** shows where relationships can be directional, e.g. social network followers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges can be **weighted** to represent quantities like distance or cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **path** is the sequence of edges used to get from one vertex to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **simple path** does not visit any node more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is **connected** if there is a path between every pair of vertices, i.e. there are no isolated nodes or clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **cycle** is a path where the first and last nodes are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Types of Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree**: An undirected graph with no cycles.\n",
    "- **Rooted tree**: A tree where one node is designated ads the root.\n",
    "- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: A directed graph with no cycles. This means edges can only be traversed in a particular direction.\n",
    "- **Bipartite graphs**: A graph where vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets.\n",
    "- **Complete graph**: A graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge, i.e. it is fully connected."

    "## 2. Implementing a Graph From Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are an abstract data structure, so there are multiple ways we can represent them in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common options are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Objects and pointers\n",
    "2. Adjacency lists \n",
    "3. Edge lists\n",
    "4. Adjacency matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each approach has its own trade-offs in terms of memory usage, ease of implementation, and efficiency based on the specific characteristics of the graph you're dealing with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement the following simple graph using each approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{mermaid}\n",
    "\n",
    "flowchart LR\n",
    "\n",
    "A[1] <---> B[2]\n",
    "B[2] <---> C[3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Objects and Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we represent each node in the graph as an object, and you use pointers to connect these nodes. Each object typically contains a list of pointers to other nodes it's connected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a *connected* graph, if we have access to one node we can traverse the graph to find all other nodes. This is not true for graphs with unconnected nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will be familiar to computer scientists - it bears a resemblance to linked lists.\n",
    "In practice this isn't used much in practical ML because traversing the graph is more cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows for flexible representation of complex relationships.\n",
    "- Ideal for graphs where nodes have additional properties beyond just connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory overhead due to object instantiation and pointer storage.\n",
    "- Can be complex to implement and manage.\n",
    "- If the graph is not connected, an additional data structure is needed to keep track of isolated nodes.\n",

    "## 5. Why Use Graph Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several categories of learning tasks we may want to perform on a graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Node classification**: Predict the category of each node. E.g. categorising songs by genre.\n",
    "2. **Link prediction**: Predict missing links between nodes. E.g. friend recommnedations in a social network.\n",
    "3. **Graph classification**: Categorise an entire graph.\n",
    "4. **Graph generation**: Generate a new graph based on desired properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several prominent families of graph learning techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph signal processing**: Apply traditional signal processing techniques like Fourier analysis to graphs to study its connectivity and structure.\n",
    "2. **Matrix factorisation**: Find low-dimensional representations of large matrices\n",
    "3. **Random walk**: Simulate random walks over a graph, e.g. to generate training date for downstream models.\n",
    "4. **Deep learning**: Encode the graph as tensors and perform deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional tabular datasets focus on the entities which are represented as rows. But often, the relationships *between* entities contain vital information. Global features, such as network-wide statistics, may also provide useful information. "
