    "The idea of GANs is that we can train two competing models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **generator** tries to convert random noise into convincing observations.\n",
    "- The **discriminator** tries to predict whether an observation came from the original training dataset or is a \"fake\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialise both as random models; the generator outputs noise and the discriminator predicts randomly.\n",
    "We then alternate the training of the two networks so that the generator gets incrementally better at fooling the discriminator, then the discriminator gets incrementally better at spotting fakes.\n",
