# 1. Time Series Properties

## Considerations for Time Series Data

Forward-looking bias. Train/test split can't shuffle.
Irregular sampling. Informative sampling.


## Trend
https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/trend

## Seasonality
https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/seasonality

Cycles https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/time-series-as-features


## Fourier Transforms
https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/seasonality

Periodogram
FFT



## Stationarity




## Correlations and Autocorrelations
### Correlation
### Autocorrelation
Serial dependence https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/time-series-as-features
Lag plots (same link as above)

### Partial Autocorrelation


#  2. Feature Engineering
## Nulls


## Lags


## Time step


## Regime Change
- Split into different models per regime
- Indicator variable for regime
- Some models explicitly model this, e.g. Hidden Markov Models


## Hybrid Models
https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/hybrid-models

Model the time series as components
`series = trend + seasons + cycles + error`


# 3. Forecasting

# 4. Classical Statistical Models

## Linear Models
https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/linear-regression-with-time-series

## AR

## MA


## ARIMA


## VAR


# 5. Traditional ML Models

## Random Forests


## Gradient Boosted Trees

##


# 6. Deep Learning

## RNNS, LSTMs, GRUs

## Transformers

## Foundational Models
