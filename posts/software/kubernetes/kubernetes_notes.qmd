# 1. Kubernetes Introduction


## 1.1. Why do we need Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source **system** (not single library) for automating the deployment, scaling and management of containerised applications, **independent of the specific cloud provider**


Manual deployment of containers is hard to maintain and error-prone. 

- Security and configuration concerns. 
- Containers crash and need to be replaced. We don’t want to have to manually monitor this and intervene. 
- Need to scale containers for traffic spikes. 
- incoming traffic should be evenly distributed. 

Services like ECS can help with some of these, such as replacing crashed containers and autoscaling. With a load balancer, it can distribute incoming traffic. 
But that locks us in to that cloud provider. 


## 1.2. What is Kubernetes?

"K8s" is the de facto standard for container orchestration. It helps with tasks like automatic deployment, scaling and load balancing, and management. 

We define the Kubernetes configuration which determines the desired architecture, number of containers etc. We can then pass this standardised, generic config to any cloud provider. 
We can also include config specific to a cloud provider without having to rewrite the entire config. 


What **isn’t** Kubernetes?

- It isn’t an alternative to a cloud provider. 
- It isn’t a specific service from a particular cloud provider. 
- It isn’t a single piece of software, it’s a collection of tools and concepts. 

Kubernetes is **like Docker Compose but for multiple machines**. 


## 1.3. Cluster Architecture and Concepts

![Kubernetes Cluster Architecture](KubernetesClusterArchitecture.svg)

A **pod** holds one or more **containers**. It is the smallest unit in Kubernetes. 

A **pod runs on a worker node**. A node is essentially a machine or virtual instance. 
Multiple pods can run on the same. Ode. 

There is also a **proxy** on each worker node, which configures the network traffic. 

Multiple pods can be created and removed to scale your app. 

There is a a **master node**. This contains a **Control Plane** which handles the creation, removal and replacement of worker nodes. 
As a user, you don’t interact with the worker nodes directly. You define the desired end state and interact with the master node, which then handles the implementation. 

The group of master nodes and all worker nodes is called a **cluster**. This then sends instructions to the cloud provider API to create all of the services required to realise the desired implementation. 


Kubernetes does not manage your infrastructure for you. You still need to create the instances for the master node and worker nodes, and any other resources like load balancers and file systems. You also need to install `kubelet` and other Kubernetes services on those nodes yourself. 

Many cloud providers have managed services to make this set up easier. But this is a service provided by the specific cloud providers, not natively by Kubernetes. 


## 1.4. Worker nodes

Think of a worker node as **one machine or virtual instance**. What happens on the worker nodes (e.g. creating a pod) is managed by the master node. 

The worker node contains one or more pods. 
Each pod hosts one or more application containers and their associated resources (such as volumes). Pods are created and managed by K8s via the master node. 

The worker node can contain multiple pods. 

- `Docker, kubelet and kube-proxy `need to be installed on the worker node. 
- `Kubelet` handles the communication between the worker node and master node. 
- `Kube-proxy` handles the network communication. 


## 1.5. Master node

The master node needs to run the **API server**. This is the counterpart to kubelet running on the worker nodes, and allows the master node to communicate with the workers. 

There is a **scheduler** which watches the pods and selects worker nodes to run new pods on. 

`Kube-Controller-Manager` watches the worker nodes and ensures the correct number of pods are running. 
There is also a `Cloud-Controller-Manager` which is the same thing but for a specific cloud provider. 


**Services** are a group of pods with a unique IP address that can interact with the outside world.


# 2. Kubernetes in Action

## 2.1. Interacting with a Deployment Object
`Minikube` is a tool to make it easy to **run Kubernetes locally**, by running a cluster in a VM on your local machine. 

You will need the `kubectl` tool installed. **This gives commands to the master node, which in turn controls the worker nodes**. 
Think of it like the president commanding the general to command his soldiers to attack. 


Kubernetes works with Objects: `pods, deployments, services, volumes`, etc. 
Objects can be created **imperatively or declaratively**. 


A pod has a cluster-internal IP address by default. Containers within a pod can communicate with each other via localhost. 

Pods are ephemeral. When they are started, stopped or replaced, any local data is lost. Just like containers, which makes sense because they are just a thin wrapper around a container. 


The `Deployment` object is **what we interact with as users**, not pods directly. 
You generally create a Deployment object which defines the desired target state. Then K8s will create the required pods and other objects. 
Deployments can be paused, deleted and rolled back. 
They can also be scaled (and auto-scaled). 


On local machine, we send commands to the cluster. We create a deployment object with `kubectl create`. The image we specify needs to exist on the cluster, not the local machine that we are sending commands from. The image should be in a registry like DockerHub. 
```bash
kubectl create deployment my-first-kube - -image=repo/my-docker-image
```

We can see the status of the deployment with:
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```
We can see the status of pods with:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

If we’re running locally, we can see our deployment with:
```bash
minikube dashboard
```

We can expose pods to the cluster or externally using a `Service` object. Pods have an internal IP address, but **Services have a static IP address** we can use to externally access it from anywhere. 

We create a service by exposing a deployment:
```bash
kubectl expose deployment my-first-kube --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
```

We can see the service with:
```bash
kubectl get services
```
Expose an external IP address when running locally with:
```bash
minikube service my-first-kube
```

To manually scale a deployment object, we can set the number of replicas we want. We can scale up and down by setting the number of replicas higher or lower than it currently is. 
```bash
kubectl scale deployment/my-first-kube --replicas=3
```

## 2.2. Updating Deployments
We can update the image in a deployment object by setting the new image. The new image should have a more recent tag, as this will trigger Kubernetes to download the newer image. 
```bash
kubectl set image deployments/my-first-kube old-image-name=repo/new-image-name
```

We can check the status of the updated deployment with:
```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/my-first-kube
```

To undo the latest deployment:
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-first-kube
```

We can see the rollout history with:
```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/my-first-kube
```

This will give a list of revisions. We can see details for a particular revision, say the 2nd revision, with:
```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/my-first-kube --revision=2
```

If we want to revert to a specific revision:
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-first-kube - -to-revision=2
```


## 2.3. Imperative vs Declarative Approach 

The **imperative approach** so far requires entering commands into the command line in the correct order. 
The **declarative approach** allows us to define the configuration which can then be reused. 

It is analogous to how we could create docker containers in the command line (imperative), or define a docker-compose.yml file with all of the configuration and simply run this (declarative). 

Once we have the configuration file defined, we just need to run:
```bash
kubectl apply -f config.yaml
```

This applies the config file to the connected cluster. 
If we change the config file, we can run the command again and Kubernetes will make the appropriate changes to get to the target state. 



## 2.4. Kubernetes Config Files
These are the config files used in the declarative approach.

### 2.4.1. Defining a Deployment Object
```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1  # See K8sdocs for the latest version
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-second-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  # A selector is needed to specify which pods should be controlled by this deployment
  selector:
    matchLabels: 
      app: second-app
      tier: backend
    # As an alternative to matching labels, we can also match on an expression. 
    # Key is still referring to the key of a label
    # Operator can be In, NotIn, Exist, DoesNotExist
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: app, operator: In, values: [second-app, first-app]}
    
  template:  
    # Define the pod object. 
    # The template of a Deployment always defines a Pod, so you don’t need to (and can’t) specify kind: Pod
    metadata:
      labels:
        # Key:Value can be whatever you like. It is used for the Deployment selector to identify the pod
        app: second-app
        tier: backend
    spec:
      containers:
      # List of containers
        - name: container1
           image: repo/my-image-name:latest
           # We can define a specific path and frequency for Kubernetes to check if this container is alive 
           livenessProbe: 
             httpGet:
               path: /some/specific/path
               port: 8080
           periodSeconds: 10
           initialDelaySeconds: 5
```

### 2.4.2. Defining a Service Object
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  selector: 
    app: second-app
  ports:
    - protocol : TCP
       port: 80
       target port: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

We apply the config the same way, with `kubectl apply`. 


We can delete all of the resources that were created by a particular config file using
```bash
kubectl delete -f=deployment.yaml 
```

We can also delete by label. You should pass the kinds of objects (e.g. deployments, services) that you want to delete. 
```
kubectl delete deployments -l key=value
```

### 2.4.3. Multiple Configs

If you have multiple configurations, such as a Service and a Deployment, you can put them all in one file. Just separate each section with three dashes `---`

The objects will be created top to bottom. 
It’s best practice to put the service before the deployment since it references the pods created later. The service will “watch” for any pods created which match its selector. 


Some other parameters of the deployment config that may be helpful:

- `imagePullPolicy` - we can set this to always pull the latest image, even if we don’t explicitly specify a tag. 
- `livenessProbe` - how Kubernetes should check the health of the container. Is there a specific path to send a request to?


# 3. Managing Data and Volumes

We are still working with containers in Kubernetes, so the concept of Docker volumes is still relevant. 
It is still solving the same problem, namely that we want persisted data to survive a container stoppage or restart. 

But Kubernetes manages our containers for us, so we can’t manually add a volume in the same way we did with Docker. 
We need a Kubernetes-specific way to add volumes. 


## 3.1. Kubernetes Volumes

Kubernetes supports a variety of types/drivers of volumes: local volumes (on nodes) or cloud-provider specific volumes. 
This is extra functionality added by Kubernetes, not supported by plain Docker. 

The lifetime of the volume depends on the lifetime of its pod. The volume survives **container** restarts, but not **pod** deletion. 

We **define the volumes inside the pod specificatio**n in the yaml file. 
We also need to specify which containers are linked to which pods using the `volumeMounts` key. 


### 3.1.1. The `emptyDir` Volume Type

The `emptyDir` volume type creates a new empty directory when the pod starts. 
It keeps the directory alive as long as the pod is alive. Containers can write to this directory. It will survive container restarts but not pod restarts. 


Under the `spec` key:
```yml
spec:
  containers:
    - name
       …
       volumeMounts:
         - mountPath: /app/story
            name: story-volume
  volumes:
  - name: my-first-volume 
     # We specify the TYPE of volume 
     emptyDir: {}
     # We create a host path volume at a specific location on the host machine. Create the directory if it doesn’t already exist
     hostPath: 
       path: /data
       type: DirectoryOrCreate
```


### 3.1.2. The `hostPath` Volume Type

The `hostPath` volume type creates a folder on the host machine. It is a bit like a bind mount in Docker. We could use it if we wanted to share some existing data. 

The host path volume is node-specific, so won’t share data across replicas on different machines. 


### CSI Volume Type

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume type is a generic interface that different cloud providers are compatible with. Different cloud providers then integrate with this, so we can plug into AWS, GCP, Azure etc, or build our own integration. 


## Persistent Volumes

The previous volume types do not scale to multiple pods. If we replicate our pods over multiple machines, they won’t share data. “Normal” volumes are node-independent but not pod-independent. The data is lost if the whole node is removed. 

Persistent volumes are pod-independent and node-independent. This is appropriate for long-term data. The volume is detached from the pod, including being detached from the pod lifecycle. We define the persistent volumes once, and can then use it across multiple deployments. The data will survive the pod or node being removed. 

The storage is not on the nodes, it is in the cloud storage.

### Defining a persistent volume 

In a new file, say pv.yaml, we can define the persistent volume. 


apiVersion: c1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 4Gi
  # We can use block storage or file system storage 
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  # Kubernetes lets you define different storage classes, but by default gives you the standard class
  storageClassName: standard
  # How many nodes (one or many) can claim this volume, and can they write or only read?
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    - ReadOnlyMany
    - ReadWriteMany
  hostPath:
    path: /data
    type: DirectoryOrCreate


### Creating a Persistent Volume Claim

We configure a claim in a new yaml file, then we can assign this to a pod so that it claims the persistent volumes. 


apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata: 
  name: my-pv-claim
spec:
  # Static provisioning is when we specify the exact volume to claim by name
  # We can also do dynamic provisioning where we specify the required properties of the volume and Kubernetes will find an appropriate volume in our cluster
  volumeName: my-pv
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: standard
  # How much storage will this claim use?
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi


We can then assign this claim to a pod under the volumes key of the pod spec:

  volumes:
  - name: my-persistent-volume 
     persistentVolumeClaim: 
       claimName: my-pv-claim


Then we can use kubectl to apply each of the updated yaml files to our cluster. 

We can see the persistent volumes and claims currently running by using:
kubectl get pv
kubectl get pvc



## Environment Variables

Under the container key of a pod specification, you can add an env key with a list of key-value pairs. 


containers:
  env:
    - name: STORY_FOLDER
       value: “story”


You can then use this env variable in your app. 


### Using an environment file

We can store environment variables in another yaml file of kind ConfigMap. This can then be reused across multiple pods and deployments. 


In a file environment.yaml


apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: data-store-env
data:
  folder: “story”


Then we can point to that file in our deployment yaml file. 


containers:
  env:
    - name: STORY_FOLDER
       # We can refer to a ConfigMap
       valueFrom:
         configMapKeyRef:
           name: data-store-env
           # Which key to we want to pull out of the env file to use as the STORY_FOLDER value?
           key: folder
