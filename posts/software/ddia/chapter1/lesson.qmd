# Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

# 1. Data Systems

Modern applications are often **data**-intensive rather than **compute**-intensive. That is to say, the bottleneck is not the CPU speed, but some aspect of data, whether that be storage, throughput or some other factor.

These applications are often built by assembling building blocks of well-established **data systems**. For example, database, caches, search indexes, stream processing, batch processing. 
The application is essentially a new, special purpose data system built from generic components.

These are often so well abstracted that we do not think too deeply about the internals of their operation. But this is key to how our overall application will perform.

This chapter serves as a gentle introduction to establish some of the key terminology in this field. Later chapters dive deeper into individual data systems that form the layers of an application.


There are three main focuses when designing software systems:

- **Reliability** - the system should continue to wrok correctly in the face of adversity
- **Scalability** - the system can deal with growth
- **Maintainability** - the system can be operated and extended
