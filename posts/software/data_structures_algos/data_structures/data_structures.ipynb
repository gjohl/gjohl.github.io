    "\n",
    "There are common ways that we can interact with different data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to frame the appropriateness of a data structure for a given based on the speed of the operations that are required most for that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read: Look up the value at a particular location in the data structure\n",
    "- Search: Look for a particular value in the data structure.\n",
    "- Insert: Add a new value to the data structure.\n",
    "- Delete: Remove a value from the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading is \"find by key\", searching is \"find by value\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a list of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is stored in memory as a block of contiguous memory addresses. When the array is declared, the head of the array is stored, i.e. the memory address of the first elelment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **size** of an array is the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "The **index** denotes where a particular piece of data resides in that array.\n",

    "### 2.1 Reading an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer can look up a given memory address in constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know the head of the array and the index to look up. So we can read in **O(1)** time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Head of the array is memory address 1063.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Searching an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer has immediate access to all of its memory addresses but does not know ahead of time their *contents*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to find a particular value, we will potentially have to search through every element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching an array is therefore **O(N)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Insertion into an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of inserting into an array depends on **where** in the array you are inserting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If inserting an element at the end, we simply place the new value at that memory address (assuming the memory address is empty). This is a constant time operation O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we insert at any other position, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shift each of the existing elements to the right of the insert index 1 position rightwards\n",
    "2. Insert the new value in the gap created.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to insert at index $i$, there are $N - i$ elements to shift (Step 1), then 1 more operation to insert the new value (Step 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case - inserting at the start of an array - insertion is **O(N)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. Deletion from an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the efficiency of deletion depends on the index being deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "If deleting the last element, there is simply 1 operation to clear the memory address, so this is a constant time operation O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we delete an element in any other position, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Delete the element. This leaves a gap in the middle of the array.\n",
    "2. Shift each of the elements to the right of the gap leftwards, to fill the gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to delete at index $i$, we do 1 operation to delete that element (Step 1), then shift the next $N-i$ elements leftwards (Step 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case - deleting the first element of the array - deletion is **O(N)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is a collection of *unique* elements, i.e. duplicate values are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways of implementing sets: array-based sets and hash-sets are discussed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Python already has sets, but we'll give outline implementations for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
