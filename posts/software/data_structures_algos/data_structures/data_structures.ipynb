    "## 1. Data Structure Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are common ways that we can interact with different data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to frame the appropriateness of a data structure for a given based on the speed of the operations that are required most for that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read: Look up the value at a particular location in the data structure\n",
    "- Search: Look for a particular value in the data structure.\n",
    "- Insert: Add a new value to the data structure.\n",
    "- Delete: Remove a value from the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading is \"find by key\", searching is \"find by value\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a list of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is stored in memory as a block of contiguous memory addresses. When the array is declared, the head of the array is stored, i.e. the memory address of the first elelment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **size** of an array is the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "The **index** denotes where a particular piece of data resides in that array.\n",

    "### 2.1 Reading an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer can look up a given memory address in constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know the head of the array and the index to look up. So we can read in **O(1)** time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Head of the array is memory address 1063.\n",
    "2. We want to look up index 5.\n",
    "3. Read memory address 1068 (because 1063 + 5 = 1068).\n",

    "> If you were asked to raise your right pinky finger, you wouldn't need to search through all of your fingers to find it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Searching an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer has immediate access to all of its memory addresses but does not know ahead of time their *contents*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to find a particular value, we will potentially have to search through every element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching an array is therefore **O(N)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Insertion into an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of inserting into an array depends on **where** in the array you are inserting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If inserting an element at the end, we simply place the new value at that memory address (assuming the memory address is empty). This is a constant time operation O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we insert at any other position, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shift each of the existing elements to the right of the insert index 1 position rightwards\n",
    "2. Insert the new value in the gap created.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to insert at index $i$, there are $N - i$ elements to shift (Step 1), then 1 more operation to insert the new value (Step 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case - inserting at the start of an array - insertion is **O(N)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. Deletion from an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the efficiency of deletion depends on the index being deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "If deleting the last element, there is simply 1 operation to clear the memory address, so this is a constant time operation O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we delete an element in any other position, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Delete the element. This leaves a gap in the middle of the array.\n",
    "2. Shift each of the elements to the right of the gap leftwards, to fill the gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to delete at index $i$, we do 1 operation to delete that element (Step 1), then shift the next $N-i$ elements leftwards (Step 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case - deleting the first element of the array - deletion is **O(N)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is a collection of *unique* elements, i.e. duplicate values are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways of implementing sets: array-based sets and hash-sets are discussed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Python already has sets, but we'll give outline implementations for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Array-based Sets\n",

    "## 5. Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables are key:value pairs. We can look up a the value for a given key in $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as hash maps, dictionaries, maps, associative arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1. Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of taking characters and converting them to numbers is called **hashing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that performs this conversion is the **hash function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash function requires one condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Consistency: A hash function must convert the same string to the same number every time it's applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, for the hash function to be useful, it should also be collision resistant:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Collision resistant: Different inputs should hash to different outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an extreme example, the following hash function is consistent but not collision resistant:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def crappy_hash(input_str: str) -> int:\n",
    "    \"\"\"This is the world's worst hash function.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2. Hash Table Lookups\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to insert the following key:value pair into our hash table:\n",
    "```\n",
    "key = \"Name\"\n",
    "value = \"Gurp\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a hash function that is actually good, and in this particular case `hash_function(key)` returns `12`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash table will then insert `value` at memory address `12` (or more specifically, the memory address of the head of the dictionary + 12).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means if we ever want to look up the key `\"Name\"`, we hash it and immediately know to access memory address 12 and return the value `\"Gurp\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So hash table lookups are $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, looking up by **key** is $O(1)$. Searching by **value** is essentially searching through an array, so is $O(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3. Dealing with Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **collision** occurs when we try to add data to a cell that is already occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to handling this is called **separate chaining**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of placing a single value in a cell, we place a *pointer to an array*. This array contains length-2 subarrays where the first element is the key and the second element is the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no collisions, a hash table look up is $O(1)$.\n",
    "In the worst case, ALL keys collide and so we essentially have to search through an array which is $O(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4. Hash Table Efficiency\n",
    "A hash tables efficiency depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How much **data** we're storing in it\n",
    "2. How many **cells** are available\n",
    "3. Which **hash function** we use\n",
    "\n",
    "A good hash function (3) should distribute the data (1) evenly across all cells (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures the memory is used efficiently while avoiding collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **load factor** is the ratio of data to cells, and ideally should be around 0.7, i.e. 7 elements for every 10 cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Complexity (Worst) | Complexity **(Average)** |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| Read      | O(N)               | O(1)                     |\n",
    "| Search    | O(N)               | Keys: O(1) Values: O(N)  |\n",
    "| Insertion | O(N)               | O(1)                     |\n",
