    "\n",
    "Sorting algorithms come up so frequently that they deserve their own section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we want to solve the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given an array of unsorted values, how can we sort them in ascending order?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with 2 pointers pointing at the first two values in the array. \n",
    "2. Compare the left and right values. If `left_value > right_value`, swap them. Otherwise, do nothing.\n",
    "3. Move both pointers one cell rightwards.\n",
    "4. Repeat Steps 2-3 until we reach values that have already been sorted. This completes the first \"pass-through\" and means we have \"bubbled up\" the biggest number to the end of the array.\n",
    "5. Start over. repeat Steps 1-4 to bubble up the second biggest number into the second to last position. Repeat this until we perform a pass through with no swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pass through loops through one fewer element:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass-through number | Number of operations\n",
    "---------|--------------\n",
    "1  | N-1\n",
    "2  | N-2\n",
    "3  | N-3\n",
    "4  | N-4\n",
    "5  | N-5\n",
    "...| ...\n",
    "k  | N-k\n",
    "\n",
    "So in total, there are $(N-1) + (N-2) + (N-3) + ... + 1$ comparisons. This is the sum of an arithmetic progression, which we can calculate as $\\frac{N^2}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also worth noting that in the worst case - an input array in descending order - each comparison will also result in a swap. This does not affect the Big-O complexity but would slow down the run time in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity is therefore **$O(N^2)$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, any nested loop should be a hint at quadratic time complexity."
