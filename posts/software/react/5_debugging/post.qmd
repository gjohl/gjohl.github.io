# Debugging

Adding JS to a page in script tags. 
Either in the body of the script tag, or preferably as a separate js file that’s then called as the src parameter of the script tag. 
The defer parameter means the script won’t be called until the rest of the body is loaded. 
The type=module parameter means the JavaScript file will be treated as a module.
