# Making Learning Whole

Notes on Making Learning Whole by David Foster. 

## 0. Introduction: A Whole New Ball Game
The are two popular schools of thought on approaching complexity:

1. Elements first: learn some abstract concepts element-by-element, then eventually put them together later.
2. Learning about: learn *about* the topic rather than learning to do it.

The problem with the "elements first" approach is that the whole game only shows up much later, if ever. So people may spend years learning elements of maths, but never actually *do* any real maths. Foster names this affliction of spending years learning elements without ever putting them together "elementitis".

The problem with "learning about" is that it can often degrade into mindless "learning other people's facts", for exmaple, learning history as a sequence of people and dates without ever thinking deeply about motivations, reliablility of sources etc. Foster names this affliction of only ever learning the periphery of the area rather than doing the topic itself "aboutitis".

For both cases, a small amount of elements first learning, to master tricky concepts, or learning about, to gain an informational backdrop, is useful. The problem is overdoing it and never playing the whole game.

A third school of thought that Foster proposes:

3. Play a junior version: pick a smaller, self-contained version of the topic and do it end-to-end.

This helps us towards **threshold experiences** - a learning experience that gets us past initial disorientation and into the whole game.

This broad view of "learning by wholes" is a theory of teaching (rather than a theory of learning). Education is choreography for learning. We should think carefully about what the appropriate "unit of learning" is.
The theory can be divided into seven principles:

1. Play the Whole Game
2. Make the Game Worth Playing
3. Work on the Hard Parts
4. Play Out of Town
5. Uncover the Hidden Game
6. Learn From the Team
7. Learn the Game of Learning

These are each explored in the following sections.


## 1. Play the Whole Game

There is an important distinction between problem solving and problem finding.

- Problem solving is working on a well-defined problem like in a textbook.
- Problem finding is finding a good topic to work on.

Playing the whole fame means doing both. If learners aren't problem finding, they aren't playing the whole game.

## 2. Make the Game Worth Playing


## 3. Work on the Hard Parts


## 4. Play Out of Town


## 5. Uncover the Hidden Game


## 6. Learn From the Team


## 7. Learn the Game of Learning


## 8. Afterword: The Future of Learning
