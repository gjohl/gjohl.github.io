## Bio
I'm a data scientist with experience at big hedge funds and plucky start-ups. I spent a few years at Man Group, both as a discretionary long-short equity analyst in GLG and on the systematic trading side as a quant in AHL, where I focused on equities and futures.

I currently work at a fintech startup called BMLL Technologies, where I lead projects doing interesting things with massive amounts of financial order book data.
