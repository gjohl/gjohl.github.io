This is a robo-advisor app to give tailored stock portfolio recommendations.

The user can input high-level preferences like their risk tolerance, industry preferences, and how closely they would like to follow the broader market.
We then perform a portfolio optimisation process to recommend a robust portfolio based on those criteria.

This is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tradeintel/id1570837417)
